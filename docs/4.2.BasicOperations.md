# Deploy

Here is a typical `deploy` instruction:

```
{
  "p":"orddefi",
  "op":"deploy",
  "tick":"half",
  "max":"210000000",
  "lim":"1000",
  "alim":"1000",
  "desc":"meme coin of Hal Finney",
  "icon":"Base64 string of icon"
}
```

Param list:  

* The `tick` parameter represents the currency name and must adhere to the following rules:
	* It must be encoded in UTF-8 and have a length of 4 when encoded in UTF-8.
	* It cannot contain "-", "_", or ":".
	* It cannot start with "@", "#", "$", or "%".
* The `max` parameter represents the total supply.
* The `lim` parameter represents the maximum quantity that can be minted per transaction.
* The `alim` parameter represents the maximum quantity that can be minted per address.
* The `desc` parameter provides a brief description of the coin.
* The `icon` parameter represents the Base64 encoded image.

Once the `deploy` operation's transaction is confirmed, everyone will be able to use `./OrdDeFi-Virtual-Machine -getcoinmeta [coin_name]` to query coin information.


# Mint

Here is a typical `mint` instruction:

```
{
  "p":"orddefi",
  "op":"mint",
  "tick":"odfi",
  "amt":"1000"
}
```

Param list: 
 
* The `tick` parameter represents the name of the coin currently being minted.
* The `amt` parameter represents the quantity minted in the current transaction. If it exceeds the `lim` parameter set in the `deploy` instruction, the minting is invalid.
* If the minted quantity exceeds the maximum limit for minting in the current address (set by the `alim` parameter in the `deploy` instruction), the available coin count will increase to the maximum limit for minting in the current address.

Please note that, to prevent `repeat mint`, the mint instruction needs to use the output with index 0 as the `TxIn[0]` for executing the mint transaction. If the `TxIn[0]` utxo has an output index other than 0 in the previous transaction, the minting is invalid.  

Based on this mechanism, only the first mint instruction will be effective when using the `repeat mint` feature.  
Mint instructions executed using the `ord wallet inscribe` without the `repeat mint` parameter will be considered valid instructions.

Once the `mint` operation's transaction is confirmed, everyone will be able to use `./OrdDeFi-Virtual-Machine -getaddressbalance [address]` to query address balance.
