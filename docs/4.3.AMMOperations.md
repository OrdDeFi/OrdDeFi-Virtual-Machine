# Add Liquidity Provider

A typical `addlp` instruction:

```
{
  "p":"orddefi",
  "op":"addlp",
  "ltick":"odfi",
  "rtick":"odgv",
  "lamt":"1000",
  "ramt":"1000"
}
```

Param List:

* The `ltick` and `rtick` parameters represent the names of the coins for which liquidity providers are being added.
* The `lamt` parameter represents the amount of `ltick` being used to add liquidity.
* The `ramt` parameter represents the amount of `rtick` being used to add liquidity.

The coins will be added to the liquidity provider pool from the current address's available sub-account, in a 50:50 ratio based on the liquidity provider's current price. Any excess coins will be kept in the available sub-account.

Once the transaction for the `addlp` operation is confirmed, you can use the following commands for further queries:  

* To retrieve liquidity provider information for a specific coin pair, use: `./OrdDeFi-Virtual-Machine -getlpmeta [coinA-coinB]`.
* To check the balance of liquidity provider tokens owned by a specific address, use: `./OrdDeFi-Virtual-Machine -getaddresslpbalance [address]`.
