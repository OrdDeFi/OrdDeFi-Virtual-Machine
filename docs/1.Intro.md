# Introduction

## Discussion about BitDNS

In a 2010 post, Hal Finney mentioned the possibility of using Bitcoin as a decentralized database. In addition to its primary function of transferring coins, Bitcoin can also be utilized for application-level data storage.

## Ordinals

In 2021, Casey embarked on the development of Ordinals. In 2022, Ordinals released its first version, 0.0.2. One of the key features of Ordinals is called inscriptions, which involves storing instructions within the Bitcoin blockchain. An indexer (virtual machine) located off-chain is responsible for parsing these instructions. Ordinals allows for the encapsulation of arbitrary media content using on-chain instructions, and the content can be queried off-chain using the transaction ID (txid), output ID (outputid), sat number, or inscription ID.

A major advancement of Ordinals is the expansion of the instruction length that the virtual machine can execute, now extended to 4MB. Prior to this, it was widely believed that Bitcoin utilized OP_RETURN to carry application-level instructions, limited to a maximum length of 80 bytes (subject to changes in Bitcoin versions). The increased instruction length provides significant room for expansion and enhancement within the application layer.

## BRC-20 and ORDI

In 2023, Domo introduced the BRC-20 protocol and the ORDI token. BRC-20 utilizes Ordinals as the data storage layer and defines three types of instructions: deploy, mint, and transfer. It implements fungible tokens on the Bitcoin Layer 1 (L1). BRC-20 tokens adhere to the principles of fair minting, with minting being free and accessible to anyone, ensuring equal minting rights for all participants. The token supply is fixed, and no additional tokens can be created.

BRC-20 represents not only a form of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain but also a challenge to the general-purpose instruction set of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). In the EVM's ERC-20 standard, smart contracts can have vulnerabilities or backdoors, leading to risks of contract ownership theft and potential token inflation by those with contract permissions. Users face challenges in conducting thorough code reviews of contracts, often relying on third-party security audits. However, even with such audits (which are paid for by project teams), vulnerabilities can still exist. These issues with EVM tokens result in users being susceptible to asset losses due to theft or token inflation. Furthermore, these challenges persist regardless of the usage of the EVM.

As a streamlined instruction set use case, BRC-20 eliminates the possibility of vulnerabilities or backdoors. Each token within the BRC-20 standard guarantees a fixed total supply, providing the strongest assurance for private property rights.

Asset issuance is the primary application of finance. Even with similar architectures, assets issued on a blockchain with a more stable underlying infrastructure exhibit higher stability compared to assets issued on a blockchain with a slightly weaker underlying infrastructure. Within the same blockchain, assets issued on Layer 1 (L1) demonstrate greater stability than assets issued on Layer 2 (L2). Moreover, the BRC-20 protocol's streamlined instruction set enhances security. These factors establish BRC-20 protocol assets and their replicas as the most stable asset types currently available.

Since the introduction of ORDI, numerous chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, have made attempts to explore the use of inscription-based fungible tokens (fair minting and streamlined instruction set virtual machines). However, apart from BRC-20, these attempts have not achieved significant advancements in terms of functionality.

## OrdDeFi Protocol, ODFI and ODGV

In the financial sector, there are three crucial applications: asset issuance, trading, and lending. BRC-20 has made significant progress in asset issuance. OrdDeFi expands the BRC-20 instruction set and provides a native Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol on Bitcoin L1, achieving the second application: trading.

OrdDefi is activated in block 829,832, which is the 50,000th block after the deployment of ORDI in block 779,832.  

### AMM Operations in OrdDeFi

In addition to the deploy, mint, and transfer instructions in BRC-20, OrdDeFi introduces additional instructions: `addlp` (add liquidity provider), `swap`, and `rmlp` (remove liquidity provider). These instructions enable users to utilize AMM algorithms for automated market-making and trading of OrdDeFi protocol assets on L1.

### Fair Mint Made Even Fairer

In the current BRC-20 fair mint process, batch minting and repeated minting allow for the engraving of a large number of tokens by splitting the outputs or splitting the transaction. This leads to a more concentrated distribution of tokens. As a result, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are driven up, and participating users incur higher costs without receiving a proportional increase in tokens.

OrdDeFi has addressed this issue with optimizations. On one hand, by imposing restrictions on `TxIn[0]` and the output index from the previous transaction, only the first mint instruction becomes effective when generating multiple mint instructions through repeat mint. On the other hand, OrdDeFi introduces the address limit setting in the `deploy` operation, allowing the deployer to restrict the maximum number of mints per individual address. These measures promote a more decentralized token distribution within the OrdDeFi protocol and enhance the fairness of the fair mint process.

### Extended Deploy and Transfer
OrdDeFi has made the following expansions to the `deploy` and `transfer` instructions:

* The deploy instruction in OrdDeFi now includes the `desc` and `icon` parameters, allowing the deployer to provide a short description and an icon image. Additionally, the deploy instruction introduces the `alim` parameter (address limit) to impose restrictions on the maximum quantity of tokens that can be minted by a single address.
* The transfer instruction in OrdDeFi adds the "to" parameter, enabling users to transfer assets in a single transaction, eliminating the need for separate "inscribe transfer" and "send transfer UTXO" steps.
